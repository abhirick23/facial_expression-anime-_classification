Human Face expression Recognition is one of the most powerful and challenging tasks in social communication. Generally, face expressions are natural and direct means for human beings to communicate their emotions and intentions.
Face expressions are the key characteristics of non-verbal communication.
Facial expressions are important in facilitating human communication and interactions. Also, they are used as an important tool in behavioural studies and in medical rehabilitation. 
Facial image based mood detection techniques may provide a fast and practical approach for non-invasive mood detection. 
The purpose of the project was to develop an intelligent system for facial image based expression classification using committee neural networks.
Here we have used a dataset where we have considered anime based images for detection. 
We  considered 'embarrassed', 'happy' and 'shock' as the expressions .
Our model achieved a very modest accuracy of 80.
